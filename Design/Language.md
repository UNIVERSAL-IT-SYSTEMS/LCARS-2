# LCARS Design Language
### Library Computer Access/Retrieval System

LCARS is a framework inspired by the LCARS interface system seen in modern Star Trek. This isn't just a basic CSS framework, it's also an attempt at designing interfaces that mimick the user experience seen in Star Trek.

### Pragmatism

We see a lot of LCARS in Star Trek, but we don't really see much of how the system works - people often tap buttons and absolutely nothing happens. Obviously in a lot of cases the sets were just lit up static images and couldn't possibly be interactive! That's not good as a modern design language so although this is _inspired_ by Star Trek LCARS we're willing to take a lot of liberties to make a genuinely useful UI system which is enjoyable to use.

### Demos

See demos of the system at [martindevans.github.io/LCARS](martindevans.github.io/LCARS). Various page linked from this page demonstrate individual concepts of LCARS design as well as some full UI mock ups.
