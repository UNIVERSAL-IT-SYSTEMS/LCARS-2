# LCARS Design Language
### Library Computer Access/Retrieval System

LCARS is a framework inspired by the LCARS interface system seen in modern Star Trek. This isn't just a basic CSS framework, it's also an attempt at designing interfaces that mimick the user experience seen in Star Trek.

### Pragmatism

We see a lot of LCARS in Star Trek, but we don't really see much of how the system works - people often tap buttons and absolutely nothing happens. Obviously in a lot of cases the sets were just lit up static images and couldn't possibly be interactive! That's not good as a modern design language so although this is _inspired_ by Star Trek LCARS we're willing to take a lot of liberties to make a genuinely useful UI system which is enjoyable to use.

### Demos

See demos of the system at [martindevans.github.io/LCARS](martindevans.github.io/LCARS). Various page linked from this page demonstrate individual concepts of LCARS design as well as some full UI mock ups.

## Principles

### Interactivity

Items in LCARS can either be interactive or not, for example buttons (interactive) vs labels (non interactive). Interactive items are indicated with rounded edges, whilst non interactive items are indicated with square edges:
