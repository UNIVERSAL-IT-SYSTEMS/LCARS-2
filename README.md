### Installing dependancies ###

You will need Nodejs and NPM, these can be found at http://nodejs.org/
Once installed you can have npm install all the other depancies by running the command:

``` bash
npm install
```

This will pull all the other programs needed from a package repository.

Once that is done all you have to do is run

``` bash
npm run gulp
```

This will build all the less and javascript, watch the files for changes, rebuild on change then serve it to the browser
